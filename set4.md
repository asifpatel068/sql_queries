Sure! Let's continue with the next set of problems related to the `Rides` table:

**Problem 36:**
- **Prerequisite**: Understand using the MAX and MIN functions in SQL / using sort and limit in MongoDB
- **Problem**: Write a query to find the ride with the highest and lowest **`fare`**.

**Solution 36:**
To find the ride with the highest and lowest fare, we can use the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Rides WHERE fare = (SELECT MAX(fare) FROM Rides);
```
Explanation: This query uses a subquery `(SELECT MAX(fare) FROM Rides)` to find the maximum fare from all rides, and then retrieves the ride(s) from the `Rides` table where the fare matches the maximum fare.

**Problem 37:**
- **Prerequisite**: Understand using the GROUP BY clause in SQL / using aggregate in MongoDB
- **Problem**: Write a query to find the average **`fare`** and **`distance`** for each **`driver_id`**.

**Solution 37:**
To find the average fare and distance for each driver_id, we can use the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT driver_id, AVG(fare) AS average_fare, AVG(distance) AS average_distance
FROM Rides
GROUP BY driver_id;
```
Explanation: This query uses the `GROUP BY` clause to group the rides by driver_id. Then, it calculates the average fare and average distance for each driver_id using the `AVG` function.

**Problem 38:**
- **Prerequisite**: Understand using HAVING clause in SQL / using match in MongoDB's aggregate pipeline
- **Problem**: Write a query to find **`driver_id`** that have completed more than 5 rides.

**Solution 38:**
To find the driver_id that have completed more than 5 rides, we can use the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT driver_id, COUNT(*) AS ride_count
FROM Rides
GROUP BY driver_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```
Explanation: This query uses the `GROUP BY` clause to group the rides by driver_id. Then, it counts the number of rides for each driver_id using the `COUNT` function. The `HAVING` clause filters the result to include only those driver_ids with a ride count greater than 5.

**Problem 39:**
- **Prerequisite**: Understand the use of INNER JOIN in SQL / Lookup in MongoDB
- **Problem**: Assuming there is another collection/table called **`Drivers`** with **`driver_id`** and **`name`** fields, write a query to find the name of the driver with the highest **`fare`**.

**Solution 39:**
To find the name of the driver with the highest fare, assuming there is a `Drivers` table, we can use the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT d.name
FROM Rides r
INNER JOIN Drivers d ON r.driver_id = d.driver_id
WHERE r.fare = (SELECT MAX(fare) FROM Rides);
```
Explanation: This query uses an `INNER JOIN` to join the `Rides` table with the `Drivers` table based on the `driver_id` column. Then, it selects the name of the driver from the `Drivers` table where the fare matches the maximum fare from the `Rides` table.

**Problem 40:**
- **Prerequisite**: Understand the concept of subqueries in SQL / using multiple stages in MongoDB's aggregate pipeline
- **Problem**: Write a query to find the top 3 drivers who have earned the most from fares. Return the drivers' ids and total earnings.

**Solution 40:**
To find the top 3 drivers who have earned the most from fares, we can use the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT driver_id, SUM(fare) AS total_earnings
FROM Rides
GROUP BY driver_id
ORDER BY total_earnings DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
Explanation: This query groups the rides by driver_id using the `GROUP BY` clause and calculates the total earnings for each driver_id using the `SUM` function. Then, it orders the result by total_earnings in descending order and limits the result to the top 3 drivers.
